\section{Project Description}
\subsection{Brief Overview}
\begin{frame}{Overview}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Issue: emissions trading is politically contentious and lacks
              \textit{trust}.
        \item Trade the right to emit carbon on the blockchain.
        \item Increase market quality through an analysis of the
              `reputation' of carbon market participants.
        \item Employ Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) certificates
              on the blockchain.
        \item Blockchain-based ESG certificates driving the automatic
              operation of a carbon market.
    \end{itemize}
