\section{Recap}
\subsection{Project Goals}
\begin{frame}{Problem}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Energy production can be certified on the blockchain.
        \item Blockchain solves an Environmental,
              Social and Corporate Governance (ESG)
              problem for energy certification.
        \item Carbon trading is a politically contentious field lacking trust.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Aim}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Can automated certification
              on the blockchain be used to deliver \textit{trust} in the market
              for carbon?
        \item Can blockchain-based hydrogen certification be used as a motivating
              example for carbon trading?
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Thesis B Aims}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Explore how \textit{Hyperledger Fabric} can be used to develop
              a blockchain carbon market.
        \item Understand the performance trade-offs
              of putting a carbon trading platform
              on the blockchain.
        \item Identify how ESG hydrogen certificates can be used to automate
              a carbon market.
    \end{itemize}
