  abstract  = {Fabric is a modular and extensible open-source system for deploying and operating permissioned blockchains and one of the Hyperledger projects hosted by the Linux Foundation (www.hyperledger.org).Fabric is the first truly extensible blockchain system for running distributed applications. It supports modular consensus protocols, which allows the system to be tailored to particular use cases and trust models. Fabric is also the first blockchain system that runs distributed applications written in standard, general-purpose programming languages, without systemic dependency on a native cryptocurrency. This stands in sharp contrast to existing block-chain platforms that require "smart-contracts" to be written in domain-specific languages or rely on a cryptocurrency. Fabric realizes the permissioned model using a portable notion of membership, which may be integrated with industry-standard identity management. To support such flexibility, Fabric introduces an entirely novel blockchain design and revamps the way blockchains cope with non-determinism, resource exhaustion, and performance attacks.This paper describes Fabric, its architecture, the rationale behind various design decisions, its most prominent implementation aspects, as well as its distributed application programming model. We further evaluate Fabric by implementing and benchmarking a Bitcoin-inspired digital currency. We show that Fabric achieves end-to-end throughput of more than 3500 transactions per second in certain popular deployment configurations, with sub-second latency, scaling well to over 100 peers.},

  abstract = {Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) has dual aims to reduce emission production and stimulate adoption of long-term abatement technology. Whilst it has generally achieved its first aim, its issues are hindering the accomplishment of the second. Several solutions have been proposed to improve ETS’s efficacy, yet none of them have considered the advancement of Industry 4.0. This paper proposes a novel ETS model customised for Industry 4.0 integration. It incorporates blockchain technology to address ETS’s management and fraud issues whilst it utilizes a reputation system in a new approach to improve ETS efficacy. Specific design of how the blockchain technology and reputation system are used to achieve these objectives is showed within this paper. The case study demonstrates the inner working of reputation-based trading system—in which reputation signifies participants performance and commitment toward emission reduction effort. Multi-criteria analysis is used to evaluate the proposed scheme against conventional ETS model. The result shows that the proposed model is a feasible scheme and that the benefits of its implementation will outweigh its drawback.}

  abstract  = {Raft is a consensus algorithm for managing a replicated log. It produces a result equivalent to (multi-)Paxos, and it is as efficient as Paxos, but its structure is different from Paxos; this makes Raft more understandable than Paxos and also provides a better foundation for building practical systems. In order to enhance understandability, Raft separates the key elements of consensus, such as leader election, log replication, and safety, and it enforces a stronger degree of coherency to reduce the number of states that must be considered. Results from a user study demonstrate that Raft is easier for students to learn than Paxos. Raft also includes a new mechanism for changing the cluster membership, which uses overlapping majorities to guarantee safety.},

  abstract = {As the application of blockchain expands from finance field to energy field, the concept of “energy blockchain” has been proposed. In energy blockchain environment, the peer-to-peer (P2P) electricity trading among prosumers is seen as one of the potential ways for supporting future electricity market development. Electricity trading pricing plays an important role in P2P electricity trading. However, existing studies rarely take interactions among prosumers into consideration while pricing. In this study, a game theory-based pricing model is proposed in a localized Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance based-Consortium Blockchain (PBFT-CB). In the proposed model, both the interactions between seller and buyer and the interactions among sellers are considered. First, a bi-level model of sellers (on the upper level) and buyers (on the lower level) is formulated in Stackelberg game, and the existence of Nash equilibrium is identified. Then, a Rule-based Iterative Pricing (RIP) algorithm is proposed to get the equilibrium prices of non-cooperative static game. The effectiveness of RIP algorithm is validated through the case study. Specifically, profit of sellers increases by 12.61% while the utility sacrifice of buyers decreases by 4.36%. The comparisons in different scenarios show the effectiveness of the proposed model. This study suggests that P2P electricity trading provides benefits to prosumers and promote the development of electricity market, and it shows the great potential of energy blockchain.}
