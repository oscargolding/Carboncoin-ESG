\chapter*{Abstract}\label{abstract}
Emissions trading schemes (ETS) are a policy tool at the forefront of the fight against climate change. In this thesis, I will present a blockchain-based approach for creating a carbon market driven by hydrogen certificates. By using carbon tokens, an effective price can be placed on the use of carbon removing a market failure existing in the production of natural resources. I will use a high-throughput permissioned blockchain to motivate how trust can be placed in a market made volatile by inconsistent government policy and scepticism on the behalf of participants.
